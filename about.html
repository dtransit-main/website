                <p>Welcome to DTransit - I'm glad you stopped by!<br><br>I created DTransit in 2023 to share my love and passion for transportation, mobility and the movement of people - everywhere. Since then, over 565,000 people have tuned in to listen to me ramble about trains, and nearly 5,000 of them decided they wanted to see more :). The channel hosts a range of videos, from weekly news updates (This Week In Transit) to bi-weekly special videos, where I focus in on one topic in particular - whether it's newsworthy for that week or not. I'm always open to suggestions, so please leave comments on the videos, whether you're suggesting a new idea, loving a recent upload, or there's something in the video that's wrong or that you don't like - please tell me!<br><br>The main focus of the channel is always on public transportation - the backbone and arterial systems our cities and communities. Whilst public transit is commonplace in the rest of the world, America significantly lags behind in terms of standardizing fast, frequent transit across the country. With the content uploaded on DTransit and That (D)Transit Blog, I'm looking to promote awareness and knowledge about public transit, fighting back against the common myths and showcasing the endless benefits of having a reliable system (for example: according to APTA, public transit generates $3 in economic output for every $1 invested!). Of course, not every small town needs a 60-station metro - but could you imagine if there were fast, frequent trips between Salt Lake City and Denver, or Austin and Dallas, or Atlanta and Orlando, or Boston and Buffalo?<br><br>As DTransit has grown and expanded, I've looked to new areas of expansion for content. Blogging has been one point on my mind for a while - and as such, I've developed the "That (D)Transit Blog", where I can articulate my thoughts on recent developments without getting behind a microphone. You'll find more diversified, more digestible and more frequent content on the blog than the channel - exactly why I started the blog!<br><br>Again, thanks for stopping by and supporting the channel. Please consider checking out the channel itself (using the buttons in the top right/menu), check out some of the videos, and leave a like or subscribe to the channel if you like what you're seeing. I'm always open to hearing my viewers' thoughts, so please leave comments regarding whatever you might think about my videos.<br><br>🚆🚆</p>
